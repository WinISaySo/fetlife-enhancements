# FetLife Enhancements
What it says on the tin. Small userscripts to make the QoL of FetLife better for the user.

# Requirements
First, you'll need an extension that will let you manage your userscripts. We recommend [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), but [GreaseMonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) has also been tested.

# The Scripts
To install a script, simply click a link below. On TamperMonkey, you should see an install screen like this:

- [Explore & Remember](https://github.com/WinISaySo/fetlife-enhancements/raw/refs/heads/main/explore-and-remember.user.js): Remembers the filters you use in any of the "Explore" Tabs.
- [Disable View Counts](https://github.com/WinISaySo/fetlife-enhancements/raw/refs/heads/main/disable-view-counts.user.js): Disables the view-count number on posts.
