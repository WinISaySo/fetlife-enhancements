# FetLife Enhancements
What it says on the tin. Small userscripts to make the QoL of FetLife better for the user.

## The Scripts

- [Explore & Remember](https://github.com/WinISaySo/fetlife-enhancements/raw/refs/heads/main/explore-and-remember.user.js): Remembers the filters you use in any of the "Explore" Tabs.
- [Disable View Counts](https://github.com/WinISaySo/fetlife-enhancements/raw/refs/heads/main/disable-view-counts.user.js): Disables the view-count number on posts.

## Help 
### Prerequisites
First, you'll need an extension that will let you manage your userscripts. We recommend [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), but [GreaseMonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) has also been tested.

### Installing Scripts
To install a script, simply click a link below. On TamperMonkey, you should see an install screen like this (though it should say 'install' instead of 'reinstall' for you):

You can also click the files directly in GitHub's file browser if you'd like to
examine the code before installing. Rather than coming back here, you can click
the "Raw" button once you're finished auditing the code to install.
